It consists of hardware modules, 3D printable cases and a custom operating system to build smartwatches with the goal that they can be assembled, repaired, and modified by everyone. There are currently two versions: Light edition (released) GPS edition (preview, work in progress) Check out the apps to see what the watch can do! Watchfaces Tools Games See the following pages for: Hardware : for ordering PCBs, or assembled watches Firmware : for infos on flashing the latest firmware 3D-Files : for 3D-printable design files Open-Smartwatch-OS : the source code on GitHub.

Git Install git from https://git-scm.com . Serial Drivers CH340 The Open-Smartwatch uses a ch340 for USB to serial. Please install the drivers from the manufacturer: http://www.wch-ic.com/downloads/CH341SER_ZIP.html Fixing error: unknown type name \u2018wait_queue_t\u2019; did you mean \u2018wait_event\u2019? On Fedora Silverblue 34 make outputs error: unknown type name \u2018wait_queue_t\u2019; did you mean \u2018wait_event\u2019? . This can be fixed by using this fork from juliagoda . Cloning the Repository Clone the source code repository recursively : git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Open-Smartwatch/open-smartwatch-os.git Then, open the directory with Visual Studio Code. Set up config.h Got to the directory include/ and take a look into the config.h.example - all instructions are noted there. Uploading Keep in mind the PCB is flipped when inserted into the watch: To set the watch into upload mode, you need to hold the lower left button and then click the reset button (top left). This enables flash mode, the display will turn dark. Press the reset button after uploading. Troubleshooting Check the cable Usually, a few cables do not have a data transmission role. Try to upload to another cable. Check the driver Check the driver insertion. Arduino_TFT.h: No such file or directory You did not clone the repository with the --recursive-submodules flag. Tip After changing the branch, follow the command : git submodule update 'LANG_STW_START' was not declared in this scope You did not rename include/config.h.example Failed to connect to ESP32: Timed out waiting for packet header You did not hold down BTN1(FLASH) and then tap the RESET button on the watch whilst platform.io was trying to connect.","title":"Firmware"},{"location":"resources/firmware/#firmware","text":"","title":"Firmware"},{"location":"resources/firmware/#features","text":"The table below list all currently available features of the OSW-OS.
