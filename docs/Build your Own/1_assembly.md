# Assembly

If you want to assemble an Open-Smartwatch on your own, you'll need a hot air gun or a reflow station.
If you don't need the acceleromter, you can hand solder everything with a little bit of practice.

See the respective watches for links to BOM/PCB and source files.

The list of components from [AliExpress](2_aliexpress.md) is only to give an orientation.
