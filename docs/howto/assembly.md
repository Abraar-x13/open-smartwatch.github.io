# Assembly

If you want to assemble an Open-Smartwatch PCB on your own, you'll need a hot air gun or a reflow station.
If you don't need the accelerometer, you can hand solder the light edition with a little bit of practice.

See the respective watches for links to BOM/PCB and source files.

The list of components from [AliExpress](aliexpress.md) is only to give an orientation.
