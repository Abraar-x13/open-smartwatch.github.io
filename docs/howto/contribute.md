## How to open a pull-request

Before you open a PR, open an issue about PR to hear others opinions - maybe someone is already working on it.

1. Create a branch based on the `origin/develop` branch.
2. Make sure to rebase on it from time to time to reflect modifications.
3. Push to your GitHub fork.
4. Open a PR - also try to mention the linked issue.

## How to open an issue

The basic issue requires a detailed explanation for understanding the bug/feature/problem. 
If you have text, pictures or videos they drastically help us understand the problem.

### Bug Report

Hey - you think you found a hidden feature? Or are you not sure about it? Well, create an issue according to this [form](https://github.com/Open-Smartwatch/open-smartwatch-os/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=). Additionally, try to attach the serial monitors logs or a video file.
